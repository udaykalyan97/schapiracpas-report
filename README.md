# Website Improvement Report for Schapira CPA  
**Prepared by:** Uday Kalyan  
**Date:** 25-05-2025  

## Overview  
This report provides a thorough review of the Schapira CPA website, highlighting key areas where improvements can significantly enhance accessibility, performance, search engine optimization (SEO), user experience (UX), security, and overall technological robustness. The assessment combines automated tool analysis with manual reviews to offer strategic and actionable recommendations that align with web development best practices and compliance standards.

## Accessibility Evaluation  
The website currently has several accessibility shortcomings. A major issue is the use of a `<noscript>` tag that contains an iframe for Google Tag Manager, which limits access for users with JavaScript disabled. Additionally, many images on the site lack descriptive alt attributes, making it difficult for screen reader users to understand the visual content. The color contrast between text and background elements also does not meet established WCAG standards, reducing readability for users with visual impairments.  

To address these concerns, it is recommended that all images include meaningful and contextually accurate alt text. For users with JavaScript disabled, alternative content should be provided to ensure continued access to critical information and functions. Furthermore, tools such as WAVE or Axe should be used to evaluate the website and resolve color contrast issues, ensuring a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for body text.

## Performance Analysis  
Performance testing indicates that the site is affected by a misconfigured Google Tag Manager script, resulting in a 404 error. This disruption not only hampers analytics tracking but may also lead to delays in loading times. Additionally, large, unoptimized images are likely contributing to poor performance, especially on slower network connections.  

To improve performance, the GTM setup should be reviewed and properly implemented to restore functionality. Image assets should be optimized by converting them to next-generation formats, such as WebP, and by applying compression techniques. Implementing lazy loading for off-screen images can further reduce initial page load times. Additional performance bottlenecks can be identified and addressed using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights or GTmetrix, which provide detailed diagnostic reports and suggestions.

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)  
A comprehensive SEO analysis reveals that the website does not have unique meta titles and descriptions for individual pages, which diminishes its visibility in search engine results and negatively impacts click-through rates. Furthermore, the absence of structured data markup means the site is missing opportunities to appear in rich snippets or enhanced listings on search platforms.  

Each page should be assigned a unique, keyword-optimized meta title and description that accurately reflect its content. Implementing structured data using Schema.org—particularly for organization and service-related types—will allow the site to communicate more effectively with search engines, improving indexing and presentation. It is also advisable to periodically review the site's backlink profile using tools such as Ahrefs or SEMrush and to engage in strategic outreach to earn high-quality inbound links from authoritative sources.

## User Experience (UX) Improvements  
From a usability standpoint, the website’s navigation is not as intuitive as it could be, especially when accessed via mobile devices. Users may find it challenging to locate key information due to inconsistent or non-responsive design elements. Additionally, the presentation of content lacks structure, which can hinder readability and engagement.  

To improve UX, a more streamlined and responsive navigation structure should be developed to function consistently across different devices and screen sizes. Content should be reorganized to include clear headings, logical sections, and the use of bullet points or highlights to guide the reader's attention. Testing the site on a wide range of devices and browsers—using tools like BrowserStack—will help ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience for all visitors.

## Security Measures  
A security analysis reveals that not all pages are consistently served over HTTPS, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of user data. The site also lacks several HTTP security headers that are considered best practices for modern web security.  

To enhance security, it is essential to implement HTTPS site-wide and enforce secure connections through automatic redirects and valid SSL certificates. Additional protection can be achieved by adding standard security headers such as Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS). These headers help mitigate risks related to content injection, MIME type sniffing, and clickjacking, among other common vulnerabilities.

## Technology Stack and Future Enhancements  
An inspection of the site’s technology stack suggests the presence of outdated libraries that should be updated to maintain compatibility with modern browsers and improve overall performance. Continuous monitoring and regular updates will ensure the website remains secure and efficient in the future.
